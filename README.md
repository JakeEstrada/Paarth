## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Architecture

Paarth follows a **client-server architecture** with clear separation between frontend and backend:

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│   React Frontend │ ◄─────► │  Express Backend │ ◄─────► │   MongoDB       │
│   (Port 5173)    │  REST   │   (Port 4000)    │  ODM    │   Database      │
└─────────────────┘   API    └─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘

- **Context API**: Global state management (if needed)
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express 5**: Web framework with middleware support
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible schema
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Clear separation of concerns
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Middleware Chain**: Authentication, validation, error handling
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction through Mongoose models

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with React component
2. **API Call**: Component calls API service function (Axios)
3. **HTTP Request**: Request sent to Express backend
4. **Middleware**: Authentication, validation, file upload processing
5. **Controller**: Business logic execution
6. **Model**: Database operations via Mongoose
7. **Response**: JSON response sent back to frontend
8. **State Update**: React component updates UI based on response

### Database Architecture

**MongoDB Collections:**
- `users`: User accounts and authentication
- `customers`: Customer information with multiple addresses/contacts
- `jobs`: Job details, stages, estimates, contracts, scheduling
- `tasks`: General tasks and todos
- `appointments`: Scheduled appointments
- `activities`: Activity log for audit trail
- `files`: File metadata and references

**Relationships:**
- Jobs → Customers (many-to-one)
- Jobs → Users (assignedTo, createdBy)
- Tasks → Jobs (optional, many-to-one)
- Tasks → Customers (optional, many-to-one)
- Activities → Jobs (optional, many-to-one)
- Activities → Customers (required, many-to-one)
- Files → Jobs (optional, many-to-one)

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Jobs: `stage`, `isArchived`, `customerId`, `assignedTo`
- Customers: Text search on `name` and `primaryEmail`
- Activities: `jobId`, `customerId` with timestamps
- Tasks: `jobId`, `assignedTo`, `dueDate` for efficient querying

## 📅 Google Calendar Integration

The application supports syncing jobs to Google Calendar for seamless scheduling. See `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Event Creation**: When jobs are scheduled, events are created in Google Calendar
- **Recurrence Support**: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly recurrence patterns
- **Event Updates**: Calendar events update when job details change
- **Event Deletion**: Calendar events are removed when jobs are archived or deleted
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication with Google APIs

### Setup Process

1. Create Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Calendar API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Configure redirect URI
5. Get refresh token
6. Add credentials to `.env` file

See `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## 💰 Payroll System

The payroll page provides comprehensive timesheet management:

### Features

- **Work Hours Tracking**: Daily hours with in/out times and breaks
- **Overtime Calculation**: Automatic weighted hours (1.5x for hours over 40 per week)
- **Travel Miles**: Track daily travel with automatic cost calculation
- **Receipts**: Add multiple receipts with descriptions
- **Print Functionality**: Clean formatted print output for payroll processing

### Usage

1. Navigate to Payroll page
2. Select date
3. Enter clock in/out times
4. Add break duration
5. Add travel miles (if applicable)
6. Add receipts (if applicable)
7. System calculates total hours and overtime
8. Print timesheet for payroll processing

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers/logs in via `/auth/register` or `/auth/login`
2. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Token returned to frontend
4. Frontend stores token (typically in localStorage)
5. Frontend includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected routes
6. Backend middleware (`requireAuth`) validates token on each request
7. User object attached to request for use in controllers

### Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords hashed using bcryptjs
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware protects sensitive endpoints
- **CORS**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests
- **File Upload Validation**: File type and size validation
- **Input Validation**: Mongoose schema validation

### Best Practices

- Use strong JWT secrets in production
- Store sensitive environment variables securely
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies
- Implement rate limiting for production
- Use MongoDB authentication in production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Backend starts but shows "MongoDB connection error"
- API requests return 503 "Database connection unavailable"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure MongoDB is running:
   ```bash
   # Check if MongoDB is running
   mongosh
   ```

2. Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/paarth
   ```

3. For MongoDB Atlas:
   - Check IP whitelist in Atlas dashboard
   - Verify connection string format
   - Check network connectivity

4. Check MongoDB logs for errors

### Google Calendar Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "Google Calendar not configured" error
- Events not syncing to Google Calendar

**Solutions:**
1. Verify all environment variables are set:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=...
   GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
   ```

2. Check that Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

3. Verify refresh token is valid (may need to re-authenticate):
   - Visit `/calendar/auth-url` endpoint
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Update refresh token in `.env`

4. Check backend logs for API errors

### File Upload Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Files not uploading
- "File too large" errors
- Files not accessible

**Solutions:**
1. Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in `.env`:
   ```env
   MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
   ```

2. Ensure `uploads/` directory exists and is writable:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backend/uploads
   chmod 755 backend/uploads
   ```

3. Verify file types are allowed (check `upload.js` middleware)

4. Check disk space on server

### Frontend Not Connecting to Backend

**Symptoms:**
- API calls failing
- CORS errors in browser console

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
   ```

2. Ensure backend is running on correct port

3. Check CORS configuration in `server.js`

4. Verify backend is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/health
   ```

### Build Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend build fails
- TypeScript errors

**Solutions:**
1. Clear node_modules and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. Check Node.js version (should be v18+):
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

3. Verify all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses MongoDB for data persistence
- File uploads are stored in `backend/uploads/`
- Developer tasks are stored in `backend/developer-tasks.json`
- The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API
- All dates are handled in local timezone
- Jobs are archived (soft deleted) rather than permanently deleted
- Dead estimates are automatically moved after 7 days of no response
